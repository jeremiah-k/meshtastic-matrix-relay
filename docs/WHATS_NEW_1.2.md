# What's New in MMRelay 1.2

MMRelay 1.2 introduces Matrix End-to-End Encryption support, enhanced authentication management, and improved Docker deployment capabilities. This release focuses on security, reliability, and ease of deployment for users upgrading from 1.1.4.

## üîê Matrix End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) Support

**The flagship feature of 1.2** - Full Matrix E2EE support enabling secure communication in encrypted Matrix rooms.

### Key Features

- **Mixed Room Support**: Handle both encrypted and unencrypted rooms in the same relay
- **Cross-Platform**: Full support on Linux/macOS, regular Matrix communication on Windows

### New E2EE Installation
```bash
# Install with E2EE support (Linux/macOS only)
pipx install mmrelay[e2e]
```

### E2EE Configuration

```yaml
matrix:
  e2ee:
    enabled: true
    key_sharing_delay_seconds: 5
    store_path: ~/.mmrelay/store
```

## üîë Enhanced Authentication Management

### New Authentication Commands
