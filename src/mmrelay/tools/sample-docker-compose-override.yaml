# docker-compose.override.yml - Local Development
#
# This file overrides docker-compose.yml to build from source instead of using prebuilt images.
# Place this file as docker-compose.override.yml in the same directory as docker-compose.yml.
#
# Docker Compose automatically merges override files when you run:
#   docker compose up
#
# To use prebuilt images (ignore this override):
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up
#
# To switch back to prebuilt permanently:
#   rm docker-compose.override.yml

services:
  mmrelay:
    # Override: Build from source instead of using prebuilt image
    build: .

    # Keep the container name consistent with base
    container_name: mmrelay

    # Optional: Development-specific environment overrides
    # environment:
    #   - LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
