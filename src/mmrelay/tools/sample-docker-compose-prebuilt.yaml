      - ${MMRELAY_HOME:-$HOME}/.mmrelay:/app/data:Z
      # For non-SELinux systems, you can use:
      # - ${MMRELAY_HOME:-$HOME}/.mmrelay/config.yaml:/app/config.yaml:ro
      # - ${MMRELAY_HOME:-$HOME}/.mmrelay:/app/data

      # For BLE connections, uncomment these lines (Linux only):
      # - /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus:ro

    # For BLE connections, uncomment one of these options (Linux only):
    # Option 1: Simple approach
    # network_mode: host

    # Option 2: With specific capabilities (less secure than option 1, but more secure than privileged mode)
    # network_mode: host
    # cap_add:
    #   - NET_ADMIN
    #   - NET_RAW

    # Option 3: Privileged mode (if all else fails)
    # network_mode: host
    # privileged: true

    # Tip: For correct permissions and paths, ensure UID, GID, and MMRELAY_HOME are set in a .env file or exported
