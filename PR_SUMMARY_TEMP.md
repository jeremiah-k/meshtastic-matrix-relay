# PR Summary: Unified E2EE Status System

Hey! Here's what we've been working on since the last commit on `e2ee-implementation`. Nothing too fancy, just trying to make the E2EE experience less confusing for users.

## The Problem We Solved

Users were getting surprised by blocked messages to encrypted rooms when E2EE wasn't properly set up. The warnings were inconsistent between startup, config check, and runtime. Some people would see their messages just disappear into the void without knowing why.

## What We Built

### Centralized E2EE Utilities (`src/mmrelay/e2ee_utils.py`)

- Single place that figures out if E2EE is ready, disabled, unavailable, or incomplete
- Handles all the platform checks (Windows limitations), dependency detection, credential validation
- Provides consistent error messages and fix instructions

### Smarter Room Listings

- When E2EE is working: `üîí Room Name - Encrypted` / `üìù Room Name - Plaintext`
- When E2EE is disabled: `‚ö†Ô∏è Room Name - Encrypted (E2EE disabled - messages will be blocked)`
- When on Windows: `‚ö†Ô∏è Room Name - Encrypted (E2EE unavailable on Windows)`

### Updated Config Check

- Uses the same logic as runtime, so predictions actually match reality
- Clear status breakdown and actionable fix instructions
- No more "E2EE support available (if enabled)" vague messages

### Better Testing

- Tests that actually verify encryption is happening (checking nio.crypto logs)
- Coverage for all E2EE scenarios instead of just happy path
- Fixed the config checker tests that broke when we unified everything

## Key Changes

**New Files:**

- `src/mmrelay/e2ee_utils.py` - The brain of the operation
- `tests/test_e2ee_unified.py` - Comprehensive E2EE testing

**Updated Files:**

- `src/mmrelay/matrix_utils.py` - Room listing now uses unified status
- `src/mmrelay/cli.py` - Config check uses centralized E2EE detection
- `tests/test_config_checker.py` - Fixed to work with new unified functions

## The Result

Users now get clear warnings about encrypted rooms when E2EE isn't ready. No more mystery blocked messages. Everything uses the same terminology and logic, whether you're looking at startup logs, running config check, or seeing runtime errors.

It's not revolutionary, but it should make the E2EE experience way less frustrating.

## Branch Info

- **Branch**: `e2ee-818-1` (branched from `e2ee-implementation`)
